Your phone lies discarded on the ground.
0
You must have tossed it here.
0
You're not sure exactly when though....
0
The last couple weeks are kind of a blur.
0
Anyway, it's battery is full. You remember charging it earlier.
0
You press your thumb up to the bottom of the screen.
0
It opens easily. The lights of the screen blink enticingly.
0
You check your notifications automatically. You have:
0
Three missed texts from your friends on Instagram
0
One missed text from your mother
0
You sigh. You really don't feel like talking to anyone today. That seems like too much effort.
0
You stare at the Instagram app. A few minutes on Instagram won't hurt anyone, right?
0
...Yeah. Yeah. You'll just scroll through Instagram for a few minutes. It's not like you're doing anything.
0
One reel turns into two. Two into three. Three into four. Four into five.
0
You check the time.
0
...
0
It's been 3 hours... 
0
...
0
Your eyes hurt. You turn off your phone and toss it back on the ground. That's enough for today. You're so tired.
0
Your energy has run out.

You must have tossed it here.
0
Oh yeah... you spent like 3 hours on it.
0
That day's kind of a blur to you.
0
Huh. It still has a lot of battery left. Like maybe 75% left.

0
You don't want to talk to your mother. You don't want to talk to anyone.
0
...
0
But you have to admit, you have been feeling kind of lonely...
0
...
0
...Maybe you'll check your friends' messages. They're your friends after all.
0
You open the group chat.

Octavian: holy we're FINALLY done with midterms
0
Marcus: I KNOW omg that was so horrible. Can't wait to spend the entire day at home playing video games
0
Agripinna: YESSSS I'm gonna sleep for like 12 hours a day. What about you alex? We haven't seen you in a while
0
...
0
They're asking about you. You should probably respond. Looks like they want to know what you're doing.
0
To be completely honest, you haven't been doing much. You've just been playing games and scrolling Instagram ever since midterms...
0
...Maybe you should tell them that. After all, Marcus is also spending the entire time playing video games.
0
You: yeah I've just been at home. Y'know just spending my day playing games, scrolling through instagram. The usual
0
You've sent the text.
0
Agrippina is typing...
0
Agrippina: haha that's so real. I've also been doing that lol
0
You smile. At least you know that you aren't the only one spending your days like this.
0
...You've missed talking to your friends.
0
...
0
Yeah...maybe you'll talk to them more often.
0
But not now. No, you're too tired now. Maybe that's enough time on the phone for today.

Your phone lies discarded on the ground.
0
Huh. The last time you went on your phone you talked to your friends.
0
Oh yeah. You talked to your friends. For the first time in a while.
0
That's nice...
0
Anyway, it still has a lot of battery. After all, you didn't spend a lot of time on it the last time. Only like a few minutes. It's on 72%.

One missed text from your mother
0
Mother: “How's school? Haven't seen you in a while, just wanted to check up.”
0
You sigh. Sure, you love your mother, but this seems like too much work. You just want to lie down and do nothing.
0
What would you even say? 
0
When Sarah wrote your messages, she always made them sound perfect.
0
How could anything you wrote compare?
0
You move towards the h key, then dart away as if stung.
0
You stare at the screen a bit more, then eventually you toss your phone back on the ground.
0
You close your eyes. Your mind starts to feel like nothing.
0
You're putting in no effort, no intelligence, no thought.
0
It's beautiful.
0
17
Huh. Looks like your phone is still laying on the ground.
0
Why'd you toss it there again?
0
Oh yeah, your mom messaged you... you didn't respond...
0
...
0
It's been a while since you've talked to her...
0
You open your mother's message. "How's school? Haven't seen you in a while, just wanted to check up."
0
You take a deep breath. It's just your mother, you've known her your entire life.
0
You stare at your screen. God, it's been so long since you've talked to her. What do you even say?
0
Can't go wrong with a simple 'good', can you? Or does that sound passive agressive...
0
Maybe add a smiley face? To indicate tone? No that's lame. She'll laugh at you behind your back.
0
Uggggghhhhhhhhhhh. You scroll up through your previous messages, and see what Sarah wrote for you in the past.
0
Maybe you can imitate the style... yeah. Like a "Good! Thanks for asking." That doesn't sound too horrible, right?
0
Okay, you know what? Screw it. She's your mother. What's the worst that'll happen? 
0
You hit send, and release a breath you didn't know you were holding. That wasn't too bad right?
0
Immediately, the fear rises back in you. What if she hates it? What if she hates YOU?
0
Agh. You throw your phone back on the floor.
0
What you don't see can't hurt you.
0
18
You have one new message.
0
It's from your mother. 
0
Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh my god she hates you. She's going to disown you. 
0
Why did you even try writing to her? Are you stupid? You can't do this without Sarah. You can't do ANYTHING without Sarah.
0
Almost despite yourself, you open the message. You feel like you should shield your eyes.
0
"Very good. Nice to hear from you again."
0
Oookkkayyyy. That sounds a little bit passive agressive, but your mother always sounds a little bit passive agressive when texting.
0
And the "very good" makes your heart swell with pride a little, as ridiculous as it feels.
0
Should you respond? Probably. It's on you to initiate now, right? That's how conversations work?
0
What can you talk about.... You're going to be fully honest, you zoned out of the last couple conversations you had with her.
0
Are you an awful person? Sure. Yeah. But Sarah took notes for you and told you what to respond, and it was so easy. And your mother liked her responses better anyway, so.
0
Sue you for being a good son.
0
Yeah that didn't even sound good in your head, huh.
0
WELL. ANYWAY. You can start making it up her right now. You vaguely remember something about her neighbour having a chicken? 
0
You fire off a short question about that, and your mother responds immediately.
0
She regales you with tales of her neighbours chicken, then tales of her neighbour, then tales of her and your father for hours.
0
Before you know it, it's nightime where she is. 
0
You say your goodbyes. Talking to her was nice. Very nice. There's a warm swell to your heart now.

You'll go on it again tomorrow.
