You stare at the pile of clothes on the floor.
0
They seem to stare back at you.
0
There's something malevolent about that gaze, you find.
0
Reflexively, you take a sniff.
0
Oh God. OH GOD.
0
IT STINKS. No, REEKS is a better word.
0
You have no idea how you haven't noticed it yet.
0
You haven't needed to change your clothes in a while.
0
You haven't needed to leave your room for a while. Sarah took care of everything that happened outside.
0
There was no one here to see you except for Sarah, and no need to impress her.
0
But for it to have gotten to this point.... And for you not to have noticed.....
0
It's disgusting. YOU'RE disgusting.
0
You should probably clean it up.
0
What's the first step again? You haven't...
0
Ah, to hell with it. You'll figure it out as you're doing it. You're no coward!
0
You shove your hand confidently into the middle of the pile, and try sifting through it.

EW EW EW EW EW EW WHAT WAS THAT
0
OH MY GOD YOU FELT SOMETHING WAS THAT A RAT
0
OH EEEEWWWWWWWW
0
YOU CAN'T DO THIS NOPE NOPE NOPE
0
NEVERMIND NOT TODAY NO THANKS

Okay. It's a new day. You are a new person! You can do this!
0
You've brought a bucket of water and some soap from the bathroom. You are going to clean this if it kills you.
0
You hesitantly reach out and grab the article of clothing that's closest to you.
0
It's an old shirt. As soon as you grab it, your fingers dart back.
0
The coast is clear, you think. No rat.
0
Phew. You can do this. You just have to believe. And persevere.
0
You extend your arm again, and get a firmer grip on the shirt. This time, you pull it back towards you.
0
Your muscles remember how to fold it from years of doing the chores at home.
0
You put it down on the ground, and move onto the next article.
0
It's hard. The work is tedious, and mind-numbingly boring. You almost give up multiple times.
0
You wish desperately that Sarah was here, to talk to you, to entertain you, to give you anything but silence.
0
And yet you continue.
0
On, and on, you continue.
0
Almost before you know it, all of your clothes are neatly folded into piles.
0
You stare at it. It stares back at you.
0
It doesn't seem malevolent anymore. It seems calm. You feel calm. Accomplished, too, in a way that you haven't in a very long time.

You'll... you'll deal with that tomorrow. You've already spent too much effort there for one day.
