You open your computer. 
0
You feel like..... maybe... maybe you should...
0
It feels like you haven't looked at your classes since you downloaded Sarah.
0
You don't think you know how to access your course.
0
Hesitantly, you open the search engine on your computer.
0
You stare at it like it will reveal all of its secrets to you.
0
It doesn't.
0
You stare at it some more. Everything seems to fade away.
0
Suddenly, you snap back into reality. You've bene inactive for too long: the computer fell asleep.
0
The screen saver swirls around with a dizzying intricacy.
0
It almost... hurts. 
0
You feel despondent. You feel useless. You ARE useless.
0
But hey, you tried, right? That has to count for something.
0
You'll look at this tomorrow. You'll feel better by tomorrow, surely.
0
You have to. 
0
19
Your head feels clearer today.
0
You seem to vaguely remember the name of the university website.
0
Your fingers confidently type in the first letter.
0
The website is the first autofill! Score!
0
You are a genius.
0
You click through the website until you find the place where your professor posts her lessons.
0
The classes seem long.... A full hour? That's insane!
0
You.... you can do that. It's fine.
0
The first video opens.
0
The professor starts talking and... wow.
0
That's.... That's a lot of. Big words. 
0
Wow.
0
Uh.
0
You... you try to focus on them. See if you can remember anything.
0
Your attention slides off like water on a duck's back. 
0
You try to hold it, to force it but it slithers out of your grasp like an eel.
0
You close the computer. 
0
Screw this. You'll try again tomorrow.
0
Probably.
0
18
Your head feels clearer. You feel sharper. You can do this!
0
You open the website, and click on the video.
0
This time, you manage to wangle your brain into listening to the video.
0
It's far from perfect, and you don't understand most of it, but it's a start.
0
You feel better already!
0
The video finishes, and you feel like a GENIUS.
0
Now, time for the homework.
0
You open the first question, and immediately feel a pit form in your stomach.
0
This.... This wasn't in the video. Surely. It couldn't have been.
0
You PAID attention. You LISTENED. You SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS.
0
It isn't fair. It isn't just!
0
Who does the professor think you are, anyway? 
0
This stuff is way too complicated for a mere 2nd year student.
0
You're too stupid for this.
0
You're too stupid for anything.
0
You can't do this. You CAN'T.
0
Not without Sarah.
0
Ugh. you'll do this tomorrow. 
0
20
You feel... uh... you feel...
0
You're not entirely sure how you feel? But it's definitely positive.
0
You are ready to face this homework. 
0
You think.
0
Are you? Are you really? YES! This is not the time for second guessing!
0
You open the homework on the computer.
0
You stare at it. You try desperately to search your brain for the answer.
0
It's not coming to you immediately. You don't like that. It makes you feel gross. Stupid.
0
It should come immediately. With Sarah...
0
NO! FOCUS. FOCUS. LOCK IN.
0
You turn the problem in your head. You vaguely remember something in the lecture about...
0
You've got it! You've got the answer! Did it take you a full 10 minutes? Yes. But you got it!!!! 
0
With renewed vigor you throw yourself into the next question. 
0
Half an hour passes.
0
Then a full hour. 
0
Then three hours. 
0
And before you know it, you've focused more than you can remember ever focusing in a long time.
0
You feel, physically, lighter. Smarter. You've come through the trial of fire still standing.
0
Okay that might be an exaggeration. BUT. The point remains.
0
You aren't stupid, you aren't useless. The world is beautiful, isn't it? 
0
2
You've spent ENOUGH TIME on the computer today. ENOUGH.
0
That is a tomorrow problem. For tomorrow.

1
You've done all you can here.
